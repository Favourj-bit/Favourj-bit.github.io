Hello, I’m Favour James. I am a Machine Learning Engineer and researcher from Nigeria, passionate about Machine Learning Methods, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Knowledge Representation.

My research interest focuses on improving the robustness, efficiency, and reliability of language models, especially when applied to real-world and scientific contexts. I am deeply interested in how LLMs can extract, structure, and reason over knowledge, and how knowledge graphs can be used both to enhance model reasoning and to make AI outputs more interpretable for users.

I participated in Google Summer of Code twice(2023 & 2024) under the National Resource for Network Biology where I worked on [generating a PyTorch Geometric(PyG) graph dataset](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2023/projects/NBZn0Zm3) and [LLM-driven scientific extraction systems](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2024/projects/biCyAipp). 

Currently, I work with the [Cytoscape Consortium](https://cytoscape.org/) where I developed LLM-based pipelines for knowledge graph construction and visualization, transforming scientific literature into structured biological interaction networks integrated with Cytoscape and NDEx, a continuation of my GSoC work in 2024.

I’m also interested in exploring the robustness and trustworthiness of language models in multilingual settings. I recently worked on evaluating how large models handle typographical noise and data scarcity in Yorùbá question answering, which resulted in a publication at AfricaNLP, ACL 2025. This work reflects my broader interest in building inclusive and reliable AI systems that perform well across languages and contexts.

I hold a B.Sc. in Electronic and Electrical Engineering from Obafemi Awolowo University, where I was actively involved in student and engineering communities. I served as General Secretary for IEEE OAU-SB, Departmental Librarian, and later as Women in Engineering Lead in IEEE OAU-SB, where I organized STEM outreach programs to promote inclusion and awareness among young women in science and engineering.
